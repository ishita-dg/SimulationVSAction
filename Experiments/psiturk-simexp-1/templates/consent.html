                    Please consider this information carefully before deciding whether to participate in this research.<br><br>

                    Purpose of the research: To examine how people plan their actions.<br><br>

                    What you will do in this research: Stimuli (images) will be presented on the computer and you will be asked to launch a ball so that it ends up in a goal area.<br><br>

                    Time required: Participation will take between approximately 15 minutes for the experimental trial.<br><br>

                    Risks: This is a minimal risk study, as there are no risks deviating from those associated with regular use of a computer.<br><br>

                    Benefits: This study provides no benefits to you individually. The study provides important information about the nature of human cognition. This has potential implications for public domains, such as healthcare policy and the justice system, where understanding the processes governing choice (e.g., of insurance, medical care, illegal substances) can lead to more psychologically effective public policy.<br><br>

                    Compensation: You will receive $2.50 for completion of this HIT.<br><br>

                    Confidentiality: Your participation in this study will remain confidential. Your MTurk worker IDs will NOT be shared with anyone outside of the research team. However, work you perform on MTurk can be linked to your public profile page. Thus, to maximize your privacy, you may wish to restrict what information you choose to share in your public profile. Your de-identified data may be shared with other researchers and used in future projects.<br><br>

                    In some cases, we may be interested in re-contacting you for additional information or to participate in a follow-up experiment. If we do, your participation is completely optional and you would be compensated appropriately for your time. If you DO NOT wish to be recontacted, please indicate your choice below.<br><br>

                    Participation and withdrawal: Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you may refuse to participate or you may choose to withdraw at any time.<br><br>

                    How to contact the researchers: If you have problems, please contact Ishita Dasgupta, ishitadasgupta@g.harvard.edu.<br><br>
